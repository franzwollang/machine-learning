# Testing a Recursive Neuro-Fuzzy System on an NP-Complete Problem

## Overview

This document outlines how to test a recursive, multi-scale, fuzzy logic-based system on an NP-complete problem. The system's strengths lie in handling high-dimensional data, discovering cluster structures, and recursively learning fuzzy logical rules via ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) layers. The selected test problem is **Subset Sum**, chosen for its adaptability to fuzzy representation, smooth objectives, and clear verifiability.

## Problem: Subset Sum (NP-Complete)

**Definition:**
Given:

- A set of integers $A = [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$
- A target sum $S \in \mathbb{Z}$

Find:
A binary vector $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ such that:
$\sum_{i=1}^n a_i x_i = S$

---

## Goal

Demonstrate that the system can:

- Efficiently encode and process fuzzy, high-dimensional representations of Subset Sum
- Apply a differentiable, global objective
- Learn and compress the solution structure through recursive fuzzy rule extraction
- Converge in polynomial time
- Recover valid binary solutions

---

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. Encode High-Dimensional Fuzzy Inputs

Each fuzzy input is a vector $\mu \in [0,1]^n$, where:

- $\mu_i \approx 1$: element $a_i$ is included
- $\mu_i \approx 0$: element $a_i$ is excluded

Optionally, enrich each vector with auxiliary features:

- Normalized index $i/n$
- Normalized value $a_i / \|A\|$
- Local statistics (e.g., moving averages, local sums)

This produces a high-dimensional dataset $\{x^{(j)}\} \in \mathbb{R}^{n + f}$, for training and fuzzy rule extraction.

---

### 2. Define the Objective Function

Let the system optimize the following loss:
$L(\mu) = \left| \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i a_i - S \right| + \lambda \cdot H(\mu)$

Where:

- $H(\mu) = -\sum \mu_i \log(\mu_i + \epsilon) + (1 - \mu_i) \log(1 - \mu_i + \epsilon)$: fuzzy entropy
- $\lambda$: weight controlling the entropy penalty

The goal is to:

- Encourage binary-like solutions (via low entropy)
- Minimize deviation from the target sum $S$

---

### 3. Run Recursive System

#### (a) Geometric Exploration:

- Cluster $\mu$-vectors using multiscale manifold learning
- Extract intrinsic dimensionality, local topologies, and stable regions

#### (b) ANFIS Rule Layer:

- Learn fuzzy IF-THEN rules between discovered clusters and loss behavior
- Refine or simplify the fuzzy rules to reduce system complexity

Repeat this two-stage process recursively until:

- The fuzzy predicate structure stabilizes
- No significant improvement in objective is observed

---

### 4. Extract and Evaluate Solutions

From final ANFIS or fuzzy structure:

- Select best-performing $\mu$ vector
- Threshold $\mu$ to binary vector $x \in \{0,1\}^n$
- Evaluate: $\sum a_i x_i == S$

Record:

- Runtime
- Number of recursion steps
- Objective value
- Final solution validity

---

## Criteria for Success

| Goal        | Evaluation                                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Convergence | Does the system halt in polynomial time?      |
| Accuracy    | Is a valid subset found when it exists?       |
| Robustness  | Does it reject unsolvable cases correctly?    |
| Generality  | Does it perform well across varied instances? |

---

## Extensions and Hardness Tuning

- **Easy instances:** Random positive integers
- **Medium:** Structured gaps or noisy additive combinations
- **Hard:** Near-half-sum or symmetric pairs (known hard Subset Sum instances)

---

## Summary

This test repurposes the recursive neuro-fuzzy system into a solver for the Subset Sum problem by:

- Expressing candidate subsets as high-dimensional fuzzy vectors
- Embedding the solution goal into a smooth, differentiable objective
- Recursively refining cluster rules through ANFIS to converge on valid solutions

If successful, this would demonstrate that your system can structurally and recursively **solve an NP-complete problem using fuzzy logic and multi-scale compression**, potentially hinting at polynomial-time resolution of a broad class of hard problems.
