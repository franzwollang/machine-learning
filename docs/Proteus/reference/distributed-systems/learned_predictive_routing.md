# Learned Predictive Routing: A Proteus-Native Protocol for Distributed Search

## 1. Abstract

This document proposes a novel protocol for executing search queries in a distributed network of Proteus-enabled agents. It eschews traditional graph-based methods like HNSW in favor of a more elegant, framework-native solution called **Learned Predictive Routing**, which is made possible by the unique capabilities of the underlying Proteus architecture. Proteus is a hierarchical learning system that builds a multi-scale geometric and probabilistic model of each agent's local data. Instead of building and maintaining a static, explicit kNN graph of all objects, this protocol uses the rich model from Proteus to allow agents to collaboratively learn a dynamic **potential field** over the network. Queries are treated as particles that greedily flow "downhill" along the steepest gradient of this field, naturally navigating towards the agent(s) holding the most conceptually relevant data.

The protocol is designed from the ground up to support both simple kNN similarity searches and complex, generalized **fuzzy predicate satisfaction queries**. It leverages the core outputs of the Proteus architecture—specifically the geometric and probabilistic understanding of local data manifolds—to guide routing decisions. The result is a highly adaptive, efficient, and scalable system for distributed search that is a natural extension of the Proteus-Omega framework's core principles.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1. The Proteus-Omega Framework: A Primer

**What is Proteus?** At its core, Proteus is not a simple clustering algorithm, but a hierarchical machine learning system designed to discover the intrinsic structure of complex, high-dimensional data. Instead of seeing data as a cloud of disconnected points, Proteus models it as a continuous geometric object—a "manifold." Its primary function is to learn a multi-scale, piecewise-linear approximation of this manifold, effectively creating a map of the data's underlying shape.

**How does it work?** The system operates in stages, as detailed in `stage_1.md` and `stage_2.md`. Stage 1 performs a rapid exploration to build a coarse but topologically correct map of the manifold using a highly optimized Growing Neural Gas (GNG) algorithm. Stage 2 then uses this map as a "warm start" to run a more computationally intensive process, building a high-fidelity model of the manifold's geometry and probability density using a dynamic simplicial complex.

**What does it produce?** The output of an agent's local Proteus instance is a rich, hierarchical description of its data landscape. For each discovered cluster (representing a "concept"), the model provides:

- A **`cluster_centroid_vector`**: The geometric center of the concept in the shared latent space.
- A **`cluster_density`**: A precise measure of how populated that concept is, derived from the model's converged `face_pressures`, which represent the probability flux across the boundaries of the local manifold geometry.
- A **linearized subspace**: A local, low-dimensional "flat" view of the manifold in that specific region.

**Why is this essential for Learned Predictive Routing?** This rich, geometric output is the key that unlocks the entire protocol. Traditional distributed search methods require building an explicit, all-to-all graph of data items, which is computationally expensive and difficult to maintain. Learned Predictive Routing bypasses this entirely. The Proteus model provides a pre-computed "map and compass" of the data. The routing protocol simply consults this map to determine the direction of "steepest descent" for any given query, turning distributed search into a simple problem of following a learned gradient downhill. The `Proteus-M` instance (described in `paper_final.md`) provides the foundation for a shared understanding. A separate **Common Vocabulary Reconciliation** protocol allows agents to align their individual `Proteus-M` models. This process ensures that, ideally, all agents share a very similar conceptual map—or at least possess a way to translate between them—which is what makes the learned gradients coherent across the network.

### 2.2. The Potential Field Analogy

The guiding principle is to move away from static, node-to-node links. Instead, we imagine the network's collective data as creating a conceptual landscape.

- **Data Density as "Gravity":** Regions of the shared conceptual space that are densely populated with data objects across the network act as "gravity wells."
- **Learned Gradient:** Each agent learns a local model of this landscape. This model doesn't map the entire field, but it can accurately predict, for any query, which direction (i.e., which peer) represents the "steepest descent" towards the relevant gravity well.
- **Query as a Particle:** A search query is injected into the network and simply rolls downhill, passed from peer to peer along the learned gradient until it settles at a local minimum—the agent or group of agents with the highest density of relevant information.

### 2.3. The Shared Conceptual Space

The absolute prerequisite for this protocol is the **Shared Multimodal Latent Space (SMLS)**, learned by each agent's local `Proteus-M` instance. This ensures that a fuzzy membership vector representing a concept is standardized and has the same meaning for every agent, enabling coherent comparison and routing.

## 3. The Protocol

The protocol operates in a continuous, three-phase cycle of surveying, learning, and routing.

### 3.1. Phase 1: The Survey (Peer-to-Peer Belief Exchange)

Agents build a local picture of their neighborhood by periodically exchanging compact summaries of their state using a gossip protocol.

1.  **The "Belief" Packet:** Each agent `A` periodically generates a `Belief` packet summarizing its state. This packet contains:

    - **Conceptual Summary:** A list of tuples describing its most prominent local data clusters, derived directly from its local Proteus model: `[(cluster_centroid_vector, cluster_density, object_count), ...]`. The `cluster_density` is a measure of how strong or well-populated that concept is locally, derived from the refined `face_pressures` in the Stage 2 model.
    - **Network Cost Summary:** A list of the agent's directly measured round-trip times (RTT) to its own immediate peers: `[(peer_B_id, RTT), (peer_C_id, RTT), ...]`.

2.  **The "Propagation" (Gossip):** An agent sends its `Belief` packet to its immediate peers. When `Agent B` receives this packet from `Agent A`, it caches it. `Agent B` now has a recent, first-hand summary of `A`'s data holdings and `A`'s network latency to its own neighbors.

### 3.2. Phase 2: The Integration (Learning the Predictive Gradient)

Each agent uses the incoming `Belief` packets from its peers to train a local, predictive routing model. This model is the core of the learned metric.

1.  **The Local Routing Model:** Each agent `B` maintains a model whose goal is to calculate a `Score` for each of its peers, given a query. This score represents the predicted "steepness" of the gradient towards that peer for that specific query. The model's objective is to learn a function: `Score(Query, Peer)`.

2.  **The Learned Metric:** The `Score` function intelligently combines conceptual relevance with network cost. When `Agent B` evaluates sending a `Query` to `Agent A`, it calculates:

    - **Conceptual Gain:** How much "closer" to the answer does `Agent A` appear to be? This is calculated using `A`'s cached `ConceptualSummary`. The specific calculation depends on the query type (see Section 4).
    - **Network Cost:** The measured `RTT` from `B` to `A`.

    The final score is a learned combination, for example: `Score = Conceptual_Gain / Network_Cost`.

3.  **Self-Correction:** The model is trained continuously. If `B` forwards a query to `A`, and `A` eventually reports back (perhaps in a response header) that the query was resolved locally with a very high degree of confidence, `B` can use this as positive feedback to reinforce its model. Conversely, if `A` reports that it had to forward the query again, `B` can use this as negative feedback, updating its model to slightly reduce `A`'s score for that conceptual region in the future.

### 3.3. Phase 3: Metric-Aligned Routing

With the learned routing model, executing a search is simple and efficient.

1.  **Query Ingestion:** A query arrives at `Agent A`.
2.  **Local Resolution:** `Agent A` first performs a full resolution of the query on its own local data holdings, generating a set of initial results.
3.  **Predictive Forwarding:** `Agent A` then feeds the query into its local routing model. It calculates `Score(Query, Peer)` for each of its direct peers.
4.  **Greedy Hop:** If the top score exceeds a certain threshold (indicating a high probability that a peer has better results), `Agent A` forwards the query to the highest-scoring peer, `Agent C`. The forwarded message contains the original query and the best results found so far.
5.  **Convergence:** `Agent C` repeats the process. The query hops through the network, following the path of greatest predicted relevance. The process terminates when an agent finds that it is the local minimum—that all of its peers have a lower score for the query than it does itself. The final results are then passed back up the chain to the originator.

## 4. Supporting Generalized Predicate Queries

The protocol's elegance lies in its ability to handle complex queries, not just simple vector similarity. This is achieved by adapting how a query is represented and how "Conceptual Gain" is calculated.

### 4.1. Representing the Query

- **kNN Query:** Represented by a single target vector, `v_q`.
- **Fuzzy Predicate Query:** Represented by a set of constraints on a fuzzy membership vector. For example, the query `(membership in C5 > 0.8) AND (membership in C9 > 0.4)` is not a point in space, but a description of a target _region_ or _sub-manifold_.

### 4.2. Adapting the Score Function

The `Conceptual_Gain` calculation changes based on the query type:

- **For a kNN Query:** The gain is a function of vector distance. When `Agent B` evaluates `Agent A`, it examines `A`'s cached `ConceptualSummary` and finds the `cluster_centroid_vector` (`c_A`) that is closest to `v_q`. The gain is a function of `distance(v_q, c_A)` and the `cluster_density` of `c_A`. A high-density cluster very close to the query vector yields a large gain.

- **For a Predicate Query:** The gain is a function of regional satisfaction. `Agent B` evaluates how well `Agent A`'s summarized data satisfies the predicate. It iterates through each `(centroid, density)` tuple in `A`'s summary and calculates how well the `centroid` vector itself satisfies the predicate constraints. The gain for `Agent A` becomes a weighted sum of these satisfaction scores, heavily weighted by the `cluster_density`. An agent whose summary shows a high-density cluster whose centroid perfectly satisfies the predicate will have an enormous conceptual gain.

This allows the routing mechanism to remain identical while intelligently handling fundamentally different types of analytical tasks.

## 5. Architectural Implications and Further Thoughts

This protocol is more than a search mechanism; it's a foundational component for distributed intelligence with several powerful implications.

- **Elegance and Framework Cohesion:** This approach is deeply integrated with Proteus's core capabilities. It uses the manifold structures, cluster descriptions, and density estimations that Proteus naturally produces. It avoids treating the system as a generic vector database, instead leveraging the rich, semantic understanding of the data to inform its operation.

- **Resilience and Scalability:** The system is decentralized and relies only on local peer-to-peer communication. There is no single point of failure. Agents can join or leave the network, and as long as the gossip protocol maintains connectivity, the learned potential field will automatically adapt to the new topology.

- **The Emergent Latency Map:** The `NetworkCostSummary` in the `Belief` packets is a valuable byproduct. Every agent builds up a picture of the RTT to its peers and its peers' peers. This creates a distributed, low-overhead latency map of the network. This map can be used for other tasks entirely separate from search.

- **Potential for Onion-Style Routing:** The latency map enables sophisticated routing strategies beyond just finding the fastest path. For an onion-routed message where anonymity is prioritized over speed, an agent could use the same gossiped network data to construct a path. Instead of choosing the lowest-latency next hop, it could choose a hop that is known _not_ to be a direct peer of the previous node in the chain. By deliberately routing through non-adjacent peers, it can construct a path that is harder to trace, using the very information that powers the predictive search to enhance security.

- **A Path to Global Query Optimization:** In a mature network, agents could learn not just _where_ to send a query, but _how to decompose it_. If a query involves concepts that an agent knows are strongly represented on two different peers, it could learn to split the query, sending partial predicate constraints to each peer, and then perform the final intersection of the results itself. This represents a higher level of emergent, collaborative problem-solving.

## 6. Unifying Conceptual and Network Space: The Socio-Technical Manifold

The protocol described above uses a learned heuristic (`Score = Conceptual_Gain / Network_Cost`) to combine two different types of information. A more advanced and principled approach is to fuse these spaces into a single, unified manifold. This "Socio-Technical Manifold" would represent the joint probability distribution of concepts and the network latencies between the agents that hold them. Routing a query would then cease to be a heuristic calculation and would instead become a pure gradient descent on this single, unified energy landscape.

### 6.1. The Role of Concept Reconciliation

This unified approach makes the **Common Vocabulary Reconciliation** protocol, as described in `paper_final.md`, an even more critical prerequisite. The shared `Proteus-M` space provides the stable, aligned conceptual axes. The Socio-Technical Manifold is then learned _on top of_ this shared understanding, mapping the network's physical topology onto the network's shared conceptual map.

### 6.2. Training the `Proteus-SocioTech` Instance

A new, high-level Proteus instance (`Proteus-SocioTech`) is trained, either by designated aggregator agents or through federated learning across all peers. This instance learns the structure of the combined manifold.

1.  **Input Vector Construction:** The fundamental event to be modeled is a potential query path from a source agent to a destination agent for a specific concept. The input vector for the `Proteus-SocioTech` model captures this event by concatenating:

    - **A Concept Vector (`v_C`):** The fuzzy membership vector for a prominent cluster centroid, taken from a peer's gossiped `ConceptualSummary`.
    - **Agent Embeddings (`embed_src`, `embed_dest`):** Learned, fixed-size vector representations for the source and destination agents.

    The final training input is the vector `[v_C, embed_src, embed_dest]`.

2.  **Learning the Joint Distribution:** The `Proteus-SocioTech` instance is trained on a stream of these vectors. The target for the learning process is the directly measured latency associated with the path (e.g., `RTT_src_dest`). The model's refined `face_pressures` (`stage_2.md`) will therefore come to represent the probability density over this combined space, effectively learning the function `P(concept, source, destination | latency)`. The clusters discovered by this instance represent common socio-technical patterns, for example: "high-latency transfers of video concepts between EU and US agent groups."

### 6.3. Principled Routing via Gradient Descent

With this model, an agent's routing decision becomes a formal query, replacing the heuristic score.

1.  **Query Formulation:** When `Agent B` considers routing a query `v_q` to its peer `Agent A`, it constructs a query vector for the socio-technical manifold: `v_st_query = [v_q, embed_B, embed_A]`.
2.  **Gradient Calculation:** `Agent B` uses its local (or cached) `Proteus-SocioTech` model to find where `v_st_query` lands on the manifold. The local density at that point corresponds to the model's prediction of the "energy" or "cost" of that path. A low-density region implies a high-cost, high-latency path. A high-density region implies a low-cost, low-latency path.
3.  **Steepest Descent:** `Agent B` performs this query for all its peers. The peer for whom the query vector falls into the highest-density region is the one chosen for the next hop. This is a true gradient descent on the learned, unified manifold.

This approach elevates the protocol from a clever combination of two metrics into a single, cohesive system that uses the full power of Proteus to navigate the complex interplay between conceptual similarity and the physical structure of the network.

## 7. Concrete Protocol and Implementation Details

This section details the concrete mechanics of building and using the `Proteus-SocioTech` model in a live, distributed network.

### 7.1. Agent Identity and Embeddings

Every agent in the network must have a unique identity. Upon first joining, an agent generates a persistent cryptographic keypair that serves as its unique ID. The public key is shared with peers.

- **Agent Embeddings:** Each agent ID needs to be mapped to a fixed-size vector embedding (`embed_agent`). For a network with a dynamic number of agents, a content-hashing approach can be used, where the agent's public key is passed through a pre-agreed hash function (e.g., SHA-256) and the first `d` dimensions of the result are taken to form the vector. These embeddings are static and publicly computable, providing a consistent way to represent agents in the manifold's input space.

### 7.2. Generating Training Data via "Path Probes"

Agents collaboratively generate training data for the `Proteus-SocioTech` model through continuous, lightweight "path probes."

1.  **Direct Probes:** Periodically, `Agent A` initiates a direct probe. It selects one of its own prominent cluster centroids (`v_C`), picks one of its direct peers (`Agent B`), and measures the RTT. It then generates a local training sample: `(input_vector: [v_C, embed_A, embed_B], weight: 1/RTT_A_B)`. A lower latency results in a higher weight.

2.  **Gossiped Probes:** This is the key to building a global picture from local information. When `Agent A` sends its `Belief` packet to `Agent B`, this packet contains `A`'s conceptual summary and its own RTT measurements to its peers (e.g., `Agent C`). `Agent B` can use this to generate a "virtual" training sample for the `A->C` path, a path it is not directly connected to. `B` creates the sample: `(input_vector: [v_C_from_A, embed_A, embed_C], weight: 1/RTT_A_C)`.

This process allows every agent to contribute training data not just for its direct connections, but for its entire 2-hop neighborhood, dramatically accelerating the learning of the global topology.

### 7.3. Distributed Model Training: A Two-Stage Approach

It is infeasible for a single agent to train the `Proteus-SocioTech` model directly on relative latency data. The core insight is that Proteus operates on absolute positions in a vector space, while network latencies define a relative graph structure. Therefore, a two-stage process is required to first transform the relative network data into absolute positions, and then learn the final unified manifold.

#### Stage A: Learning the "Network Manifold" via Belief Propagation

The first goal is for the network to collaboratively create a "Network Manifold," a shared vector space where the Euclidean distance between any two agents' vector embeddings is a faithful approximation of their network RTT. This is achieved not with a brittle, alignment-based method, but with a robust, product-sum-style belief propagation algorithm.

1.  **State (Probabilistic Belief):** Each agent `A` maintains a probability distribution, `P(coord_A)`, representing its belief about its own absolute position in the Network Manifold. This is initialized as a wide, uninformative Gaussian.

2.  **Message Passing:** Agents iteratively refine their beliefs based on messages from their neighbors.

    - **Message Calculation:** A message `m_{B->A}(coord_A)` represents agent `B`'s belief about `A`'s position. It's calculated from `B`'s own belief `P(coord_B)` and the measured `RTT_AB`. The message effectively describes a "fuzzy sphere" of probability around `B`'s believed position.
    - **Belief Update (Product-Sum):** Agent `A` updates its belief by multiplying its prior belief with the incoming messages from all its neighbors: `P_new(coord_A) ∝ P_old(coord_A) * m_{B->A}(coord_A) * m_{C->A}(coord_A) * ...`. This is the "product" step.

3.  **Convergence:** This message-passing cycle repeats. With each iteration, the beliefs (distributions) sharpen as more constraints are integrated. Once the beliefs stabilize, the final, canonical vector `embed_net_A` for each agent is taken as the mean of its converged probability distribution.

#### Stage B: Federated Learning of the `Proteus-SocioTech` Model

With stable, network-aware agent embeddings, the system can now learn the final Socio-Technical Manifold in a principled way. The flawed `1/RTT` weighting scheme is no longer needed.

1.  **Clean Input Vectors:** The training input vectors are now `[v_C, embed_net_src, embed_net_dest]`, where the `embed_net` vectors are the coordinates derived from Stage A. The network topology is now encoded directly and correctly in the input data.

2.  **Standard Federated Update Cycle:** The training proceeds in standard federated epochs:
    - **Local Training:** Each agent runs the _un-weighted_ Proteus learning algorithm on its local copy of the `Proteus-SocioTech` model, using all the clean input vectors it has generated.
    - **Model Update Exchange:** Agents exchange compact summaries of their model's changes with peers.
    - **Model Averaging:** Each agent integrates the updates from its peers to form a new consensus model for the next epoch.

This two-stage process is more robust and theoretically sound. It uses the right tool for each job: a distributed graph embedding algorithm to understand network topology, and the Proteus algorithm to discover the conceptual geometry of the resulting unified data space.

### 7.4. Detailed Query Routing Example

The following steps illustrate how `Agent A` routes a query `v_q`, assuming it has peers `B`, `C`, and `D`.

1.  `Agent A` first resolves the query locally. If it needs to forward, it proceeds.
2.  It constructs three query vectors for its local `Proteus-SocioTech` model, one for each potential hop:
    - `v_st_B = [v_q, embed_A, embed_B]`
    - `v_st_C = [v_q, embed_A, embed_C]`
    - `v_st_D = [v_q, embed_A, embed_D]`
3.  For each query vector, `Agent A` performs an inference pass on the model. It finds the winning simplex for that vector and retrieves the local probability density associated with that region (e.g., from the sum of the `face_pressures` of the winning simplex's vertices, as refined in Stage 2). This density value is the "score."
    - `Score_B = Density(v_st_B)`
    - `Score_C = Density(v_st_C)`
    - `Score_D = Density(v_st_D)`
4.  `Agent A` compares the scores. If `Score_C` is the highest, `Agent C` is determined to be the direction of steepest descent on the unified manifold.
5.  The query is forwarded to `Agent C`, and the process repeats.

## 8. Multi-Scale Manifold Learning for Overlay Optimization

To effectively inform an overlay like Hydra, the system must learn two related but distinct maps of the network. The first is a pure **Network Manifold** that models only the latency-based topology, optimizing for communication efficiency. The second is the **Socio-Technical Manifold** which models the joint distribution of data and network topology, optimizing for data discovery.

### 8.1 The Network Manifold: Modeling Pure Communication Efficiency

The first objective is to create a multi-scale map of the network's physical structure, ignorant of the data the nodes contain. This map is used to optimize base communication paths (e.g., for gossip or model update exchanges).

1.  **Stage A: Deriving Absolute Network Coordinates (Belief Propagation):** This stage remains as described in Section 7.3. The agents collaborate to run a distributed belief propagation protocol on their relative RTT measurements. The output is a canonical, absolute vector `embed_net` for each agent, representing its position in a shared latency space. This set of vectors forms the base Network Manifold.

2.  **Stage B: Discovering Hierarchical Network Structure (`Proteus-Net`):** A dedicated, federated Proteus instance, let's call it `Proteus-Net`, is trained on the set of all agent `embed_net` vectors.
    - **Input:** The input for this model is simply the `embed_net` vector for each agent in the network.
    - **Output:** `Proteus-Net` discovers the hierarchical cluster structure _of the network itself_. It will naturally partition the agents based on network proximity, discovering clusters that correspond to racks, data centers, and geographic regions. The output is a multi-scale, purely topological map of the network.
    - **Application:** The Hydra overlay can use the clusters discovered by `Proteus-Net` to form its base districts. This aligns the overlay's communication topology with the measured reality of the network, minimizing the latency for any background gossip or administrative traffic.

### 8.2 The Socio-Technical Manifold: Modeling Data and Latency

This second, richer manifold is built _on top of_ the stable Network Manifold. Its purpose is to guide data-specific queries.

1.  **Input Construction:** This is the `Proteus-SocioTech` model as previously described. Its input vectors are `[v_C, embed_net_src, embed_net_dest]`. The crucial difference is that the `embed_net` vectors are now understood to be the stable coordinates derived from the `Proteus-Net` learning phase.

2.  **Learning the Conditional Distribution:** The federated `Proteus-SocioTech` instance learns the joint distribution of concepts _and_ network positions. It discovers clusters that represent patterns like: "The concept of 'financial transactions' is frequently exchanged between agents in the 'New York DC' cluster and agents in the 'London DC' cluster."

### 8.3 A Two-Tiered Approach to Overlay Formation and Routing

This separation allows the Hydra overlay to make more sophisticated, context-aware decisions. Instead of one set of districts, it can maintain both a physical and a logical topology.

1.  **Physical Districts (from `Proteus-Net`):** The primary, stable districts of the Hydra overlay are formed based on the pure topological clusters from `Proteus-Net`. This ensures that general-purpose communication within a district is always hyper-efficient.

2.  **Logical, Data-Aware Routing (from `Proteus-SocioTech`):** When a data query is issued, the system uses the `Proteus-SocioTech` manifold for routing. The query for `v_q` is not just looking for the peer with the lowest latency; it's looking for the peer that lies in the direction of the steepest gradient on the _combined_ manifold. This allows a query to intelligently hop between physical districts if the socio-technical model indicates that the most relevant data lies elsewhere.

For example, a query originating in the "US-East" physical district might be immediately routed to an agent in the "EU-West" district if the `Proteus-SocioTech` model shows that the highest density for that specific query concept exists there. The underlying routing path between the districts would still be optimized using the pure `Proteus-Net` map, but the decision to make the hop is purely data-driven.

This two-manifold approach provides a clean separation of concerns. It allows the overlay to optimize its physical topology and its data-routing logic independently, using two specialized but architecturally consistent models derived from the same Proteus framework.

## 9. Security and Byzantine Robustness

The standard Belief Propagation protocol, while efficient, is vulnerable to Byzantine actors. A malicious node could report false RTT values, poisoning the beliefs of its neighbors and corrupting the final learned manifold. To counter this, the protocol must be extended to include a distributed auditing and trust mechanism. This transforms the base algorithm into a more secure **Audited Belief Propagation**.

### 9.1 The Nature of the Threat

A Byzantine agent `B` can primarily attack the system in two ways:

1.  **Reporting False Latencies:** `B` can lie about its measured RTT to a peer `A`. It can claim the RTT is much higher or lower than reality.
2.  **Propagating False Information:** `B` can lie to `A` about its measured RTT to a third party, `C`, in its gossip messages.

The most dangerous lie is claiming an impossibly _low_ latency, as this can make a malicious node appear central to the network, distorting the entire manifold geometry.

### 9.2 The Audit Mechanism: Trust via Skeptical Damping and Manifold Consistency

Real-world networks are not perfect metric spaces, making a simple triangle inequality check a fragile basis for trust. To handle both legitimate network non-linearities and potential Byzantine attacks, the audit protocol is refined into a multi-stage process based on skeptical damping and final validation against the global consensus.

1.  **Skeptical Damping for Uncertain Claims:** When agent `A` observes an apparent violation of the triangle inequality from its direct measurements involving peer `B`, it does not immediately distrust `B`. Instead, it flags the incoming message from `B` as "Uncertain" and applies a **Skeptical Damping Factor** during its belief update. Assuming an honest majority (`f < 1/2`), a principled choice for this factor is **`T_u = 1/2`**.

    - **Justification:** Applying the trust score as an exponent (`message^T`), a score of `1/2` effectively halves the evidentiary weight of the uncertain message. This requires that a claim be corroborated by at least one other independent (and equally uncertain) peer to have the same influence as a single, fully trusted message. It ensures that the larger, more coherent set of messages from the honest majority will always overwhelm isolated, inconsistent claims from either network quirks or malicious actors during convergence.

2.  **Final Audit via Manifold Consistency:** The "Uncertain" status is temporary. The definitive judgment of trust happens only after the Network Manifold has started to converge. Agent `A` can then perform the true audit of `B`'s contentious report.
    - It compares `B`'s originally reported `RTT` with the geodesic distance `||embed_net_B - embed_net_C||` in the learned global manifold.
    - **If Consistent:** If the reported RTT aligns with the globally-agreed-upon geodesic distance, the system concludes the network path was simply non-linear. The uncertainty was justified but not malicious. `Agent A` removes the "Uncertain" flag for `B` and restores its trust score to `T=1` for future interactions.
    - **If Inconsistent:** If `B`'s report is a significant outlier against the stable manifold geometry formed by the honest majority, `A` can now be highly confident the report was a lie. It permanently sets `B`'s trust score to `T=0`, ensuring its future messages are ignored.

This patient, two-stage approach allows the system to remain robust to real-world network conditions while ensuring that, over time, the consensus of the honest majority will correctly identify and isolate Byzantine actors.

### 9.3 Trust-Weighted Belief Propagation

The calculated trust scores are then used to directly modulate the Belief Propagation algorithm, effectively "muting" the influence of untrustworthy actors.

The belief update rule is modified. The original rule was:
`P_new(A) ∝ P_old(A) * m_{B->A}(A) * m_{C->A}(A) * ...`

The new, trust-weighted rule becomes:
`P_new(A) ∝ P_old(A) * (m_{B->A}(A))^{T_{A->B}} * (m_{C->A}(A))^{T_{A->C}} * ...`

The influence of each neighbor's message is now raised to the power of the trust score that `A` holds for that neighbor.

- If `T_{A->B} = 1` (full trust), the message has its full, intended effect on the update.
- If `T_{A->B} = 0` (no trust), the message term `(m_{B->A})^0` becomes `1` and has **no influence** on the product. The malicious message is mathematically ignored.
- If `0 < T_{A->B} < 1`, the message's influence is "damped," contributing to the belief but with less weight than messages from more trusted peers.

This creates a self-policing system. Agents that lie are progressively isolated from the consensus-forming process, their malicious messages ignored by their honest peers. The learned Network Manifold becomes a consensus reality built only from the verified, auditable "min latency" measurements.

## 10. Advanced Protocol: The Elastic Network Manifold

A fixed embedding dimension `D` for the Network Manifold is a practical starting point, but a truly adaptive system should discover the optimal dimensionality required by the network's intrinsic complexity. This can be achieved by wrapping the Audited Belief Propagation protocol in a meta-learning loop, creating an **Elastic Network Manifold** that can grow on demand.

### 10.1. Handling Complex Topologies

The Belief Propagation (BP) protocol is inherently well-suited to the complex, non-linear, and potentially disconnected topologies of real-world networks.

- **Non-Linearity:** By operating on probabilistic beliefs rather than rigid constraints, the BP algorithm finds a maximum likelihood Euclidean embedding that best approximates the non-linear relationships inherent in network latencies (e.g., trans-oceanic links).
- **Topological Holes:** If the network is partitioned into disconnected graphs, the BP protocol correctly models this. Each partition converges to its own stable internal coordinate system, but the different partitions will "float" relative to each other, as no messages are passed between them. The resulting manifold accurately represents the network's disconnected state.

### 10.2. Dynamic, Stress-Based Dimensionality Growth

The system determines the required dimensionality (`D`) autonomously.

1.  **Initialization:** The network initializes with a small default dimensionality (e.g., `D=4`).
2.  **Converge and Measure Stress:** The BP protocol is run until the agent beliefs converge to a stable `D`-dimensional embedding. Each agent then calculates its local "embedding stress" by comparing the distances in the learned manifold to the true measured RTTs for its neighbors.
3.  **Consensus on Global Stress:** Local stress values are gossiped, allowing all agents to compute the average global stress for the current embedding.
4.  **Trigger Growth:** If the global stress exceeds a quality threshold, a "Growth Proposal" is initiated and ratified by consensus, signaling that the current `D` is insufficient.
5.  **Residual Fitting:** Upon ratification, all agents grow the manifold's dimensionality.
    - The existing `D`-dimensional embedding is frozen.
    - A new, secondary BP process is launched in a small, `d_residual`-dimensional space (e.g., `d_residual=2`).
    - This new process is tasked with embedding the _residual error_ from the primary embedding (`| ||embed_A - embed_B|| - RTT_AB |`).
    - Once converged, the new canonical network embedding for each agent becomes the concatenation of the two vectors: `embed_net_new = [embed_net_frozen, embed_residual]`.
6.  **Continuous Adaptation:** This cycle repeats, allowing the system to incrementally add dimensions as needed to create a sufficiently high-fidelity map of the network without human intervention.

### 10.3. Adaptive Growth and Architectural Consolidation

The elastic growth protocol can be made more sophisticated and efficient with two further refinements: an adaptive growth factor and a mechanism for consolidating architectural debt.

1.  **Adaptive Growth Factor:** Instead of using a fixed size for the residual space, the system can learn the optimal growth rate. After a growth cycle, all nodes can calculate the marginal utility of the expansion: `Utility = Δ_stress / d_added`. By observing the trend of this utility, the network can decide on the next growth size. If utility is high and increasing, it can be aggressive and double the next `d_residual`. If utility is low or diminishing, it can be more conservative, maintaining or halving the growth factor.

2.  **Architectural Consolidation:** The residual fitting approach implies running multiple BP instances in parallel, which increases network traffic. While this is acceptable for short-term adaptation, it creates "architectural debt." To manage this, the system can periodically run a **Consolidation Protocol**.
    - A new, single BP instance is initialized in the full `D`-dimensional space.
    - To ensure rapid convergence, this new instance is "warm-started": each agent's initial belief is a sharp Gaussian centered on its existing, stable coordinate from the composite model.
    - The network runs this new BP instance on the original RTT data until it converges.
    - The old, parallel BP instances are then retired, and the system proceeds with the single, more efficient, consolidated model. This provides both rapid adaptation and long-term efficiency.

### 10.4 The Self-Reinforcing Feedback Loop: Accelerating Discovery

While the system can function with a simple, iterative learning process, it can be made significantly more efficient and elegant. The output of the `Proteus-Net` analysis—the fuzzy membership vector describing each node's position in the network's cluster hierarchy—is a powerful piece of metadata. Instead of being just a final output, it can be fed back into the core discovery protocols to create a virtuous, self-reinforcing cycle.

1.  **From Coordinate to Concept:** After an initial bootstrap, each agent `A` possesses both its raw `embed_net_A` coordinate and a richer fuzzy membership vector, `fuzz_net_A`, describing its fractional membership across the clusters of the `Proteus-Net` manifold.

2.  **Proteus-Accelerated Belief Propagation:** This `fuzz_net_A` vector can be used as a powerful topological prior to supercharge subsequent runs of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm (e.g., after a consolidation or during continuous refinement).

    - **Without Acceleration:** A node's initial belief `P(coord_A)` is a single, wide, uninformative Gaussian.
    - **With Acceleration:** A node can use `fuzz_net_A` to create a much more intelligent initial belief. Knowing its primary cluster memberships and the locations of those clusters from the `Proteus-Net` model, it can initialize its belief `P(coord_A)` as a **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**. Each component of the GMM corresponds to a cluster, weighted by the agent's membership in it.

3.  **Benefits of the Loop:** This feedback mechanism dramatically accelerates convergence by providing a highly-informed starting point for the BP algorithm, reducing the search space and the number of message-passing iterations needed to stabilize the network manifold. It also makes the system more robust by anchoring each node's belief about its position to its understanding of the broader network topology.

This creates a self-policing system. Agents that lie are progressively isolated from the consensus-forming process, their malicious messages ignored by their honest peers. The learned Network Manifold becomes a consensus reality built only from the verified, auditable "min latency" measurements.

## 11. Security Addendum: Byzantine-Resistant Stress and Growth

A critical challenge arises when the evidence for model inadequacy (high embedding stress) is identical to the evidence for certain malicious behaviors. An honest node in a high-stress region could be unfairly distrusted, or a Byzantine node could mask its lies. The protocol must be refined to distinguish between these two cases and to ensure the stress aggregation that triggers growth is itself Byzantine-resistant.

### 11.1. Decoupling Trust from Stress

The solution is to decouple the mechanisms: the trust audit should only punish blatant, verifiable lies, while a separate, secure protocol handles the aggregation of model stress.

1.  **The Trust Audit (Verifiable Lies Only):** A node's trust score is now only penalized for provable inconsistencies based on the triangle inequality applied to its _reported RTTs_, not the embedding. If `Agent B` tells `Agent A` about a path to `C` that is topologically impossible given `A`'s other direct measurements, `A` can lower its trust in `B`. However, if `B`'s data simply doesn't fit the current low-dimensional embedding well, this is _not_ a trust violation.

2.  **The Stress Metric (Model Fidelity Only):** An agent's local stress `| ||embed_A - embed_B|| - RTT_AB |` is treated as a measure of the model's current inability to represent reality, not as a fault of agent `B`.

### 11.2. Secure Stress Aggregation via Verifiable Histograms

To prevent Byzantine nodes from poisoning the global stress metric (e.g., by reporting extreme stress to trigger growth prematurely), a secure aggregation protocol is needed. This ensures that as long as an honest majority exists, the global stress metric will be accurate.

1.  **Local Stress Histogram:** Each agent calculates its local stress values for all its neighbors and bins them into a private **histogram**.
2.  **Zero-Knowledge Proof of Honesty:** The agent then uses a zero-knowledge proof system (e.g., a SNARK) to generate a compact, cryptographic proof. The proof attests to the statement: _"I constructed this histogram honestly from my private RTT measurements and the public network embedding vectors."_ The proof is generated without revealing the RTTs themselves.
3.  **Gossip of Verifiable Histograms:** Agents gossip these `(histogram, proof)` pairs.
4.  **Tamper-Proof Aggregation:** Any agent can verify the proofs from its peers in constant time. It is computationally infeasible for a Byzantine node to create a valid proof for a fake histogram. To compute the global stress, an agent simply downloads all gossiped pairs, verifies the proofs, discards any that are invalid, and sums the valid histograms.

This aggregated histogram provides a robust, un-poisonable view of the global stress distribution. The system can now reliably distinguish between a global fidelity problem (a long tail in the aggregated histogram, which triggers a growth cycle) and a local trust problem (a specific node failing triangulation audits), making the entire elastic manifold protocol robust, secure, and truly self-correcting.

### 11.3. Byzantine-Resistant Model Reconciliation

The reconciliation protocol itself is a potential attack vector. A Byzantine agent could send a fraudulent summary of its model (e.g., junk cluster centroids) to poison its peers' models. This is countered by using the high-level `Proteus-SocioTech` model as an auditor for the summaries being exchanged.

1.  **The Audit Step:** When `Agent A` receives a cluster centroid summary from `Agent B`, it audits each centroid `c_B_i` before integration. It constructs a query for its `Proteus-SocioTech` model: `v_audit = [c_B_i, embed_B, embed_A]`, which asks, "How plausible is it that `B` would report concept `c_B_i` to me?"

2.  **Plausibility Check:** If this query lands in a high-density region of the socio-technical manifold, the centroid is plausible and is integrated normally. If it lands in a very low-density region, it is anomalous.

3.  **Dampening Anomalies:** Anomalous centroids are not discarded immediately, but their influence during the reconciliation nudge is heavily dampened by a high skeptical damping factor (e.g., `T_anomaly = 1/4`). This allows the network to be cautiously open to genuinely novel structures while robustly rejecting junk data. An agent that consistently reports anomalous centroids that are not eventually corroborated by the honest majority will see its overall trust score decay to zero, at which point its summaries are ignored entirely.
