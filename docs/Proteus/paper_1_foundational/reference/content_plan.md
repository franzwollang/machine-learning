# Content Plan: Proteus Foundational Paper (Minimal Core)

This document outlines the structure for the paper: "Proteus: Adaptive Scale-Space Analysis for Learning Non-Linear Fuzzy Manifold Memberships." This version focuses exclusively on the core methodology for building the generative model.

---

### 1. **`00_abstract.tex`**: Abstract

- **Goal:** Provide a dense, one-paragraph summary of the core methodology.
- **Content:**
  - Briefly introduce the problem of modeling complex, multi-scale data with high fidelity.
  - State Proteus as a novel solution.
  - Mention the core two-stage architecture (fast scaffolding + high-fidelity refinement).
  - Highlight the key outcome: a rich, generative simplicial complex model that intrinsically captures the data's hierarchical, fuzzy-membership structure.
  - Hint at the model's superior descriptive power as shown in experiments.

### 2. **`01_introduction.tex`**: Introduction

- **Goal:** Motivate the problem and introduce the Proteus modeling method.
- **Content:**
  - Start with the "grand challenge": real-world data is high-dimensional, non-linear, and has structure at multiple scales.
  - Discuss the limitations of current methods (e.g., speed vs. fidelity trade-off).
  - Introduce the Proteus framework as a novel two-stage solution that resolves this trade-off to produce a superior data model.
  - Briefly explain the core ideas: adaptive scale-space analysis and recursive decomposition to build a model representing non-linear manifold memberships.
  - Provide a roadmap for the rest of the paper.

### 3. **`02_related_work.tex`**: Related Work

- **Goal:** Position Proteus within the existing academic landscape.
- **Content:**
  - (No changes) Manifold Learning, Hierarchical Clustering, Scale-Space Analysis, Generative Models.
  - Conclude by clearly stating the unique contribution of the Proteus modeling process.

### 4. **`03_framework.tex`**: The Proteus Framework

- **Goal:** Provide a detailed technical explanation of the model-building architecture.
- **Content:**
  - **High-Level Overview:** Present a diagram of the two-stage, recursive pipeline.
  - **Stage 1: Fast Exploratory Scaffolding:**
    - Detail the node-centric GNG model.
    - Explain the meta-learning loop for discovering characteristic scales.
    - Define the "hierarchical scaffold" output.
  - **Stage 2: High-Fidelity Manifold Refinement:**
    - Introduce the simplicial complex representation.
    - Explain the physically-motivated learning rule.
    - Detail the "dual flow" mechanism and its grounding in the Divergence Theorem.
  - **The Generative Model and its Properties:**
    - Explain that the final artifact is a complete generative model.
    - Describe how the model's hierarchical and probabilistic nature inherently represents a point's "fuzzy membership" to various structures at different scales. This is a property of the model itself, not a specific feature vector output.

### 5. **`04_analysis.tex`**: Model Quality Analysis

- **Goal:** Empirically validate the quality and fidelity of the generated model.
- **Content:**
  - **Datasets:** Describe synthetic datasets with known ground-truth topologies (e.g., nested spheres, linked tori) and real-world datasets.
  - **Evaluation Metrics:** Define metrics that measure the quality of the model, such as:
    - **Topological Accuracy:** Compare the Betti numbers of the learned manifold to the ground truth.
    - **Reconstruction Error:** Measure how well the model can reconstruct the original data points.
    - **Log-Likelihood:** Evaluate the data's probability under the final generative model.
  - **Comparative Analysis:** Present results comparing the Proteus model's fidelity to models produced by other SOTA algorithms.
  - **Ablation Studies:** Provide experiments that demonstrate the necessity of both Stage 1 and Stage 2 for achieving high model quality.

### 6. **`05_conclusion.tex`**: Conclusion

- **Goal:** Summarize the contribution and suggest future work.
- **Content:**
  - Reiterate the problem and how the Proteus modeling process solves it.
  - Summarize the key contributions (the two-stage architecture, adaptive scale-space analysis, and the resulting high-fidelity generative model).
  - Briefly restate the key experimental findings regarding model quality.
  - Discuss limitations and future work, explicitly stating that the rich model produced enables a wide array of applications (search, classification, etc.) which will be detailed in subsequent work.
