# Plan for Paper Content and Sectioning

This document details the content for each section of the final LaTeX paper, explaining how to repurpose existing text from `paper.md` and what new content must be created.

### 1. Abstract (`sections/00_abstract.tex`)

- **Action:** Direct copy from `paper.md`.
- **Notes:** Ensure LaTeX-specific formatting for mathematical symbols if needed.

### 2. Introduction (`sections/01_introduction.tex`)

- **Action:** Use the existing text from Section 1.
- **Notes:** This section is strong. It clearly states the problem with standard SFCs and introduces the Ensemble ρ-SFC framework. Crucially, it already contains the necessary paragraph clarifying the dependency on the upstream Proteus clustering framework, which properly scopes this paper's contribution.

### 3. Related Work (`sections/02_related_work.tex`)

- **Action:** This section must be written from scratch. It is a critical component of a formal academic paper.
- **Content Plan:**
  1.  **Standard Space-Filling Curves:** Briefly discuss the properties of Hilbert and Z-order curves, establishing them as the baseline. Cite canonical works (e.g., Moon et al.).
  2.  **Adaptive Indexing Structures:** Position the framework relative to other methods that adapt to data distribution, such as R-Trees, k-d trees, and Quad-Trees. Explain that while these are spatially adaptive, they don't use a continuous 1D metric derived from a curve.
  3.  **Prior Work in Adaptive SFCs:** Directly address the cited work on the `βρ‑Indexing Method` (Wierum, 2002). This is essential for positioning the "Ensemble" contribution as the novel element.
  4.  **Succinct Data Structures:** Repurpose the content from Section 3.8 (`Relationship to Succinct Data Structures and Wavelet Trees`) here. It provides excellent context for the architectural choices made in the framework's backend.

### 4. The Ensemble ρ-SFC Framework (`sections/03_framework.tex`)

- **Action:** This section will consolidate the core theory of the framework. It should focus on the "what" and "why," not the implementation details.
- **Source Material:**
  - `2. Problem Statement`: Defines the goals and the `cluster number` metric.
  - `3.1. Theoretical Foundation: Density-Guided Curves`: Explains the mixture model.
  - `3.2. Theoretical Foundation: The Global Metric`: Explains the ensemble consensus.
  - `4.2. Average-Case Performance: The Argument for c=1`: The probabilistic argument for good performance.
  - `4.3. Generalization to Higher Dimensions`: The theoretical argument for why the approach is dimension-independent.
  - `5. The Core Advantage: A Unified, Manifold-Aware Metric`: The high-level explanation of the benefits in low and high dimensions.

### 5. System Architecture and Implementation (`sections/04_architecture.tex`)

- **Action:** This section details _how_ the framework is made feasible. It should contain the concrete pseudo-code and implementation details.
- **Source Material:**
  - `3.3. The Feasibility Challenge`: The motivation for the architecture.
  - `3.4. The Architectural Solution I: Functional "Recipe Trees"`: High-level concept.
  - `3.5. The Architectural Solution II: The Hierarchical Cascade`: High-level concept.
  - `5.3. Query Performance and the "Fast Path" Implementation`: The detailed pseudo-code for the recipe tree query.
  - `3.7. The Hierarchical Cascade in Action`: The detailed pseudo-code for the kNN cascade.
  - `7.3. Key Generation Strategies`: The critical discussion of the Global Average vs. Hierarchical Composite keys.

### 6. Analysis and Properties (`sections/05_analysis.tex`)

- **Action:** This section will contain the formal, mathematical analysis of the framework's properties.
- **Source Material:**
  - `4.1. Worst-Case Bound`: The formal theorem and proof for the clustering bound.
  - `4.4. The Asymptotic Nature of the Geometric Advantage`: The analysis of how the geometric benefit changes with dimensionality.

### 7. Feasibility Study: Indexing Wikipedia (`sections/06_case_study.tex`)

- **Action:** Repurpose the existing analysis as a case study.
- **Source Material:**
  - `7.4. Detailed Index Size Calculation`: This entire section serves as a stand-alone, back-of-the-envelope analysis. The note clarifying its theoretical nature must be preserved.

### 8. Conclusion (`sections/07_conclusion.tex`)

- **Action:** Use the existing text from Section 8.
- **Notes:** It's a concise summary of the contributions and correctly highlights the two keying strategies.

### 9. References (`references.bib`)

- **Action:** Convert all entries from Section 9 into proper BibTeX format.
- **Example:**
  ```bibtex
  @article{Moon2001,
    author    = {Bongki Moon and H. V. Jagadish and Christos Faloutsos and Joel H. Saltz},
    title     = {Analysis of the clustering properties of the Hilbert space-filling curve},
    journal   = {IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering},
    volume    = {13},
    number    = {1},
    pages     = {124--141},
    year      = {2001}
  }
  ```
