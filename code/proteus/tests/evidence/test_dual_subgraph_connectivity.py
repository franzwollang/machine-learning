"""Affected dual-subgraph connectivity + Stage-2 dual-flow stub (SI S10.4 / #43).

Green tests lock:

* Pure BFS hook and ``dual_connected=False`` ⇒ evidence-path reject (hand-built
  adjacency dicts — not a Stage-2 dual/face graph).
* Experimental ``stage2.dual_flow`` adjacency producer (facet-sharing) behind
  ``DualFlowConfig.enable_dual_adjacency`` / ``GateConfig.apply_dual_adjacency``
  (proposal-path, default off).
* Wired path: build dual adj → ``affected_dual_subgraph_connected`` →
  ``score_edit`` / ``EvidenceGate.evaluate`` rejects disconnect.

Gaps vs full SI S6 (do **not** flip these elsewhere yet):

* No online face-pressure tallies (S6.1), conservative BP solve (S6.2), boundary
  taxonomy (S6.3), or simplex-local density (S6.4).
* Mass-conservation / density / benchmark ``@awaiting("stage2.dual_flow")``
  tests remain xfail until that producer lands.
* Acceptance path still defaults open when adjacency is ``None`` / flags off.
